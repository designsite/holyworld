              A Hindu temple is a symbolic house, seat and body of divinity. It is a structure designed to bring human
              beings and gods
              together, using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism. The symbolism and structure of a
              Hindu temple
              are rooted in Vedic traditions, deploying circles and squares.It also represents recursion and equivalence
              of the
              macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers, and by "specific alignments related to the geography
              of the place
              and the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron". A temple incorporates all elements of Hindu
              cosmos—presenting
              the good, the evil and the human, as well as the elements of Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of
              life—symbolically presenting dharma, kama, artha, moksa, and karma.

              <p>Situated in the Himalayan range of Garhwal area (Uttarakhand), Kedarnath temple is one of the most
                sacred Shiva temples
                in the world. This holy abode of Shiva is said to be built by the Pandavas to atone for their sins
                committed during
                their battle with Kauravs. The temple was restored by Adi Sankaracharya in 8th century. It is one of the
                Chota Char
                Dhams of Uttarakhand and requires a pilgrim to walk a distance of 14 kms over the hilly surface. One can
                make use of a
                pony or manchan to simplify the journey.Surrounded by the glaciers and snow-covered peaks and standing
                at a height of 3,583 m, the temple is closed during
                winters due to severe cold conditions.</p>

                religion. It is also one of the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites (comparatively minor pilgrimage
                sites). It is one
                of the 108 temples dedicated to Lord Vishnu (Divya Desams), which find mention in the works of Tamil
                saints who existed
                from 6th to 9th century.The ancient abode of Lord Vishnu can be visited only between April to November
                as in the rest of the months the weather
                is too harsh for undertaking a pilgrimage journey.</p>

                architecture is dedicated to Lord Sun. And resembling his carriage, the temple has been built in the
                shape of a chariot,which has twelve wheels and is shown as being dragged by the seven horses.The temple
                is believed to be constructed in the 13th century by a king called Narasimhadeva. Like with most things
                in
                India, this temple too has connections with a few legends. As per one of the legends, God Krishna
                cursed, one of his own
                sons with leprosy. To seek penance, Samba worshiped Lord Sun (Surya) for a period of twelve years.
                Pleased with his
                devotion, Surya healed him. Samba made the Sun temple in return to express his gratitude.</p>

                According to a
                legend, Som got the temple built in the honor of Lord Shiva as it was Shiva who cured the illness, which
                was inflicted
                on him due to his father-in-law’s curse.It is one of the most revered ‘jyotirlings’ among the 12
                existing jyotirlingas of India. The temple is located in
                Prabhas Kshetra in Saurashtra (Gujarat). Prabhas Kshetra is also the region in which, it is believed

                structures built in

                Stupa. A Stupa is a holy place of Buddhist, which is built in the shape of a dome that consists of
                relics of Buddha.A UNESCO World Heritage Site – This famous pilgrimage site in India was built by the
                great emperor Asoka in the 3rd
                century BC. There are four intricately designed gateways surrounding the Stupa known as Toranas, each

                Dhams) of the Hindus.

                The reason for its being so sacred is the belief that Lord Rama along with his wife Sita first landed on
                its shore after
                defeating the demon Ravana (who was also a Brahmin). To seek atonement for killing a Brahmin, Rama
                wanted to pray to
                Shiva. Hanuman was sent off to Kailash to bring an idol of the God. In the mean time, Sita made a small
                lingam. The one
                made by Sita is called Ramalingam and one brought by Hanuman is called Vishwalingam.</p>

                (sister) are placed.

                Non-Hindus cannot enter the premises of the temple. They can get a good view of this magnificent temple
                from the
                roof-top of the Raghunandan Library located just opposite to the temple. The annual and world famous
                Rath Yatra
                conducted at Puri gives a chance to get a good glimpse of the Lord Jagannath along with Balabhadra and
                Subhadra riding
                on the chariots. Thousands and thousands of people pulling the sacred chariot makes for a mesmerizing
                spectacle.</p>
